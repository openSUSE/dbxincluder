=======================
Overview of dbxincluder
=======================

dbxincluder is an implementation of the XInclude 1.1 specification (https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude-11)
with support for DocBook transclusion (http://docbook.org/docs/transclusion).


Limitations
===========

It does not support the XInclude 1.1 "xpointer" attribute, as the XPointer functionality is currently not exposed by lxml.
